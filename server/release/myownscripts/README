This directory is for your custom scripts.

In order to activate your scripts, you must configure wolfpack.xml.
Open wolfpack.xml and search for the "Definitions" key. Replace it with the following:
<option key="Definitions" value="myownscripts/preload.xml;definitions/index.xml;myownscripts/index.xml" />

Preload.xml is not neccessary, unless you use only default wolfpack scripts.
It is used in order to override certain functions. You will put your scripts in there like that:
<script>myownscripts.override</script>

Index.xml is something like the default index.xml. You can put in there new scripts and definitions.
