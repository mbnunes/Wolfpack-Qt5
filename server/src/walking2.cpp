// This is my attempt to rewriting the walking code. I'm going to take the code and documentation
// that others before me have used and incorporate my little (big?) fixes and comments.

// Many thanks to all of the previous contributors, and I hope these changes help out.
// Lord Binary
// Morrolan
// Anti-Christ
// fur            : 1999.10.27 - rewrite of walking.cpp with documentation!
//                : 1999.10.27 - ripped apart walking into smaller functions
// Tauriel        : 1999.03.06 - For all of the region stuff
// knoxos         : 2000.08.?? - For finally making use of the flags, and height blocking


// Now, off to the races. If you see a function somewhere, and don't know what it is, a
// description of what the function does will be located right before it in the code... with
// the logic, if possible.

/*
** Walking() This function is called whenever we get a message from the client
** to walk/run somewhere.   It is also called by the NPC movement functions in this
** class to make the NPCs move.  The arguments are fairly fixed because we don't
** have a lot of control about what the client gives us.
**
** CHARACTER s - Obviously the character index of the character trying to move.
**
** dir - Which direction the character is trying to move. The first nibble holds
** the cardinal direction.      If the bit 0x80 is set, it means the character is
** running instead of walking.  
**              0: // North
**              1: // Northeast
**              2: // East
**              3: // Southeast
**              4: // South
**              5: // Southwest
**              6: // West
**              7: // Northwest

/********************************************************
  Function: cMovement::CheckWalkable

  Description: (knoxos)
    Rewritten checkwalk-function, it calculates new z-position
    for a walking creature (PC or NPC) walks, and checks if 
    movement is blocked.

    This function takes a little more calculation time, than the
    last one, since it walks two times through the static-tile set.
    However at least this one is (more) correct, and these VERy guys 
    now hit their noses on the walls.

    In principle it is the same as the World-kernel in UMelange.
   
  Parameters:  
    CHARACTER c           Character's index in chars[]
	int x, y			  new cords.
	int oldx, oldy		  old cords.
	bool justask		  don't make any changes, the func. is just asked
						  "what if"..

  Return code:
    new z-value        if not blocked
    invalid_z == -128, if walk is blocked
